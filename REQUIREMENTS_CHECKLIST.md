## 📊 Implementation Details

### Status Values
| Status      | Value         | Color  |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Open        | `open`        | Green  |
| In Progress | `in_progress` | Amber  |
| Closed      | `closed`      | Gray   |

### Authentication Flow
```
Landing → Login/Signup → Session Created → Dashboard → Tickets
```

### Security Pattern
```php
// All database operations filter by email
WHERE email = user_email
```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test Landing Page
1. Visit `http://localhost:8000`
2. Verify hero section with wavy SVG

4. Verify feature boxes with shadows
5. Verify max-width 1440px
6. Verify responsive on mobile/tablet

### Test Authentication
