# TicketController - Final Implementation Summary

## ✅ All Requirements Met

### 1. ✅ Security: Email Check in delete()
- **Line 233-236**: Verifies ticket ownership with email check before delete
- **Line 238-241**: Blocks unauthorized deletion attempts  
- **Line 244-247**: Deletes only when both `id` AND `email` match (double security layer)

### 2. ✅ SQL-Based Calls (No Simplified Syntax)
- **Line 28-31**: `fetchAll('SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE email = ? ...')` - explicit SQL
- **Line 120-122**: `fetchOne('SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE id = ? AND email = ?')` - explicit SQL with security
- **Line 181-183**: Same SQL pattern for updates with email check
- **Line 233-236**: Same SQL pattern for delete with email check

### 3. ✅ Validation Redirects
- **Line 66**: Redirects to `/tickets/create` on store() validation errors
- **Line 74**: Redirects to `/tickets/create` on store() status validation errors
- **Line 168**: Redirects to `/tickets/{id}/edit` on update() validation errors
- **Line 176**: Redirects to `/tickets/{id}/edit` on update() status validation errors
- **Line 65, 73, 167, 175**: Sets form data with `Session::setFormData($data)` for retry

### 4. ✅ Edit Method Added
- **Lines 102-143**: Complete `edit()` method that:
  - Checks authentication
  - Loads ticket with email verification
  - Renders edit form with ticket data
  - Handles errors gracefully

## Controller Methods

| Method | Route | Security | Logic |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| `index()` | GET /tickets | ✅ Auth only | Fetches tickets WHERE email = user.email |
| `store()` | POST /tickets | ✅ Auth + CSRF | Inserts with email check |
| `edit()` | GET /tickets/{id} | ✅ Auth + Email | Loads ticket WHERE id AND email |
| `update()` | POST /tickets/{id} | ✅ Auth + CSRF + Email | Updates WHERE id AND email |
| `delete()` | POST /tickets/{id} | ✅ Auth + CSRF + Email | Deletes WHERE id AND email |

## Security Features

### Triple-Layer Protection on Delete
1. **CSRF Token**: `requireCSRF()` prevents cross-site attacks
2. **Authentication**: `requireAuth()` ensures user is logged in
3. **Email Verification**: Checks both `id` AND `email` match user's email

### Example Attack Prevention

**Attack**: Attacker tries `POST /tickets/12345/delete` with their CSRF token

**Defense**:
```php
// Line 233-236: Email check prevents this
$ticket = $this->db->fetchOne(
    'SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE id = ? AND email = ?',
    [$ticketId, $user['email']]  // Attacker's ticket 12345 not in their email
);

// Line 238-241: Fails validation
if (!$ticket) {
    Session::setFlash('error', 'Ticket not found...');
    $this->redirect('/tickets');
}
// Attack blocked! ✅
```

## Database Methods Used

- `fetchAll()` with explicit SQL + params array
- `fetchOne()` with explicit SQL + params array  
- `insert()` with data array
- `executeUpdate()` for updates
- `executeDelete()` for deletes (both use email filter)

## React Equivalence Table

| React | PHP |
|-------|-----|
| `.select("*").eq("email", userEmail)` | `SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE email = ?` |
| `.insert([{ title, description, status, email }])` | `insert('tickets', [title, description, status, email])` |
| `.update({...}).eq("id", id).eq("email", email)` | `executeUpdate('tickets', [id, email], [updates])` |
| `.delete().eq("id", id)` | `executeDelete('tickets', [id, email])` + pre-check |

## Status Values

Matches React exactly:
- `'open'`
- `'in-progress'`  
- `'resolved'`

No `'closed'` status as React doesn't use it.
